# Minimum-Coin-Change-Problem

You are given an integer array of coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. 
You have to return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins,
you will return -1. You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin. 

Letâ€™s see an example to get a clear idea of this problem coin change:- 

You are given an array of coins: [1   2   5]
Now the amount you have to make is 11. So you can see that the minimum number of coins that will be used are 3 i.e 5 + 5 + 1. Hence you have to return 3 as output.

Two approaches have been used to solve this problem and their efficiencies are compared.
